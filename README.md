# Data_Visualisation_System

The Data Visualisation System Project is a project designed so that vast amounts of data can be easily understood through visualisations. 
The following is a brief overview of the working of the system:

•	The system accepts a dataset from the user as input. 
•	It prompts the user to enter the type of visualisation they desire.  
•	It then plots the graph based on the dataset and the type of plot requested by the user.
•	It displays the resulting graph to the user.
